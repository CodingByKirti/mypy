One-Pager Overview â€“ My Role & Contributions
1. Activities & Time Commitment
Technology Exploration: Researching new tools (Alteryx, Anaplan Model Builder) to enhance team efficiency.
Solution Development for Recharges Team: Saving ~26 hrs/month (7 hrs already implemented).
HDPI GL Extract Automation: Saves ~4 hrs/month.
Ad-hoc Automation Support: Addressing process inefficiencies (e.g., Cost Template Automation).
Qlik Dashboards Management: Maintaining & updating views for:
Time to Hire
Cost Reporting
Forecast Dashboard
Forecast into Journal
Anaplan Support: Preparing & validating data for Global Role Exercise.
Time Investment Factors: SOP availability, task complexity, and stakeholder responsiveness significantly impact delivery timelines.
2. Key Stakeholders & Engagement Channels
Finance COE Team: Primary point of interaction for automation requests, clarifications, and process understanding.
Business Managers (BMs): Engaged on a need basis for project details, but their availability is a challenge.
Engagement Methods:
Regular check-ins with Finance COE for alignment
Ad-hoc discussions with BMs for project inputs
Email/slack-based communication for automation requests
3. Key Challenges & Roadblocks
Limited Stakeholder Availability: Many projects stall due to delays in responses from BMs.
Lack of Process Documentation: SOPs are often missing, making automation difficult.
Resistance to Automation: Some stakeholders perceive automation as a threat to manual roles.
Scope Creep & Abandoned Projects: Stakeholders often change requirements midway or drop projects without communication.
âœ… Past Attempts to Address Challenges:

Follow-ups to ensure clarity â†’ Often leads to long delays.
Self-driven documentation â†’ Requires additional effort without formal approvals.
Proactive automation suggestions â†’ Met with hesitation or resistance.
4. Opportunities for Improvement & Next Steps
ðŸ“Œ Streamlining Engagement & Visibility:

Formalizing a structured automation request & approval process to avoid abandoned projects.
Setting clear timelines & checkpoints for stakeholder inputs to avoid indefinite waiting periods.
ðŸ“Œ Enhancing Documentation & SOPs:

Encouraging teams to maintain standardized process documents for smoother automation.
Proposing a central repository for business processes & automation requests.
ðŸ“Œ Driving a Proactive Automation Culture:

Showcasing successful automation use cases to demonstrate impact & encourage adoption.
Creating automation training sessions for stakeholders to ease resistance.

--------------------
Key Challenges & Considerations
Stakeholder Availability: Timely inputs are essential for project completion.
Process Documentation: Clear SOPs would streamline automation efforts.
Evolving Requirements: Aligning automation with dynamic business needs requires flexibility.
Perception of Automation: Some stakeholders are cautious about automation, either due to concerns about its impact on their roles or the belief that manual processes offer more control and accuracy. Encouraging a shift in perspectiveâ€”seeing automation as a tool to enhance efficiency while allowing teams to focus on higher-value tasksâ€”can help drive adoption.
