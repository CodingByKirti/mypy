Here's a VBA code to find and delete unused formulas in an Excel workbook:

*Find Unused Formulas:*
```
Sub FindUnusedFormulas()
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim rng As Range
    Dim f As Formula
    Dim unusedFormulas As String
    
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    
    For Each ws In ThisWorkbook.Worksheets
        For Each rng In ws.UsedRange
            If rng.HasFormula Then
                Set f = rng.Formula
                If Application.CountIfs(ws.UsedRange, "=" & f) = 1 Then
                    unusedFormulas = unusedFormulas & ws.Name & "!" & rng.Address & vbCrLf
                End If
            End If
        Next rng
    Next ws
    
    If unusedFormulas <> "" Then
        MsgBox "Unused formulas found:" & vbCrLf & unusedFormulas
    Else
        MsgBox "No unused formulas found."
    End If
    
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub
```

*Delete Unused Formulas:*
```
Sub DeleteUnusedFormulas()
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim rng As Range
    Dim f As Formula
    
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    
    For Each ws In ThisWorkbook.Worksheets
        For Each rng In ws.UsedRange
            If rng.HasFormula Then
                Set f = rng.Formula
                If Application.CountIfs(ws.UsedRange, "=" & f) = 1 Then
                    rng.ClearContents
                End If
            End If
        Next rng
    Next ws
    
    MsgBox "Unused formulas deleted."
    
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub
```

*Combined Code with User Prompt:*
```
Sub FindAndDeleteUnusedFormulas()
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim rng As Range
    Dim f As Formula
    Dim unusedFormulas As String
    
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    
    For Each ws In ThisWorkbook.Worksheets
        For Each rng In ws.UsedRange
            If rng.HasFormula Then
                Set f = rng.Formula
                If Application.CountIfs(ws.UsedRange, "=" & f) = 1 Then
                    unusedFormulas = unusedFormulas & ws.Name & "!" & rng.Address & vbCrLf
                End If
            End If
        Next rng
    Next ws
    
    If unusedFormulas <> "" Then
        response = MsgBox("Unused formulas found:" & vbCrLf & unusedFormulas & vbCrLf & "Do you want to delete them?", vbYesNo)
        If response = vbYes Then
            For Each ws In ThisWorkbook.Worksheets
                For Each rng In ws.UsedRange
                    If rng.HasFormula Then
                        Set f = rng.Formula
                        If Application.CountIfs(ws.UsedRange, "=" & f) = 1 Then
                            rng.ClearContents
                        End If
                    End If
                Next rng
            Next ws
            MsgBox "Unused formulas deleted."
        End If
    Else
        MsgBox "No unused formulas found."
    End If
    
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub
```

*How to Use:*

1. Open the Visual Basic Editor (VBE) by pressing Alt + F11 or navigating to Developer > Visual Basic.
2. Create a new module by clicking Insert > Module.
3. Paste the desired code into the module.
4. Run the code by clicking Run > Run Sub/UserForm or pressing F5.

*Note:*

- These codes only check for unused formulas within the used range of each worksheet.
- Be cautious when deleting formulas, as this action is irreversible.
- Make sure to backup your workbook before running the delete code.
