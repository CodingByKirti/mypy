Here's the modified code:
```
import easygui as eg

def select_files():
    # Create a window with a single title
    title = "Select Your Files"

    # Create a window with two labels and two file selection fields
    fields = ["Main File", "Secondary File"]
    file_paths = eg.multenterbox(msg=title, fields=fields, file=True)

    # Return the selected file paths
    return file_paths

# Call the function to open the window
file_paths = select_files()

# Print the selected file paths
if file_paths:
    print("Main File:", file_paths[0])
    print("Secondary File:", file_paths[1])
else:
    print("No files selected")
```
This code creates a window with a single title, two labels ("Main File" and "Secondary File"), and two file selection fields using `eg.multenterbox`. The `file=True` parameter allows file selection. The selected file paths are returned as a list and printed to the console.

The `multenterbox` function also includes submit and cancel buttons. If the user clicks cancel, the function returns `None`.
