Had a discussion with the BMs about the next steps and the scope for including all data source files.
We're creating a draft set of columns based on the GHA and OR files for the BMs to review, allowing them to add any more columns they need. This will be finalized by October 8th.
We decided that we wonâ€™t need the Appian extract since Anaplan data will suffice.
Chandra will be sending over the Anaplan report soon.
Discussed the plan to reconcile data with the Taleo report to identify positions in the Taleo report that are already present in the GHA file due to advanced hiring.
We will leverage best practices from the position tracker file to create the master file, extending its functionality to Finance-level data
