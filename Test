Task	Description	Status
Anaplan Report Base File Preparation	Created and updated the Anaplan Consolidated report.	‚úÖ Completed (03-Mar)
Anaplan Rate File	Automated Python script to generate the Rate Card based on RTN + Country + GCB level.	‚úÖ Completed (03-Mar)
Anaplan Report Sample Split File	Created a sample file for submission to Vlima.	‚úÖ Completed (07-Mar)
Anaplan Report Splits by L3 and Region	Developed a macro for generating multiple split files by L3 and Region. The latest split was sent to Anshul & team. (Macro is slow; Python implementation is advisable.)	‚úÖ Completed (13-Mar)
Billing File Update	Updated and sent the Billing file as per the request.	‚úÖ Completed (17-Mar)
Code Updates for New L2/L3 Changes	Updated existing scripts to reflect changes in L2/L3 structures.	‚úÖ Completed
Leavers Process	Adjusted the process to align with new L2/L3 changes.	‚úÖ Completed (12-Mar)
Transaction Listing	Modified to reflect structural updates.	‚úÖ Completed (11-Mar)
JML File	Under review by Ritu/Himangi.	‚è≥ In Progress
GIRS Activity	Developed a consolidated file with control checks. Awaiting input files and SOP from Sandipan/Nachiketa. (Discussed in person)	üîÑ Pending (30-Mar-2025)
Cost Template	Discussion held with Priyanka. Considering Saqib‚Äôs file as the base. Chandra suggested pausing work as he has an alternative approach but needs time to finalize.	‚è≥ On Hold
SOD Process Walkthrough	Reviewed process with Rav Prasad. No automation scope identified due to dependency on multiple tools (Atlas, GIAM, EIM). Manual intervention required.	‚ùå No Scope

Alteryx simplifies and automates data tasks that Excel handles manually, reducing effort, saving time, and enhancing efficiency‚Äîespecially for repetitive and complex workflows. While it excels in data preparation, transformation, and automation, tasks like real-time collaboration and report formatting may still require Excel.

Capabilities of Alteryx
Automates repetitive Excel tasks like data cleaning, merging, and filtering.
Handles large datasets efficiently without performance slowdowns.
Performs complex calculations and transformations with minimal effort.
Integrates data from multiple sources (Excel, databases, APIs, etc.).
Reduces manual errors through standardized workflows.
Enables advanced analytics such as forecasting, variance analysis, and trends.
Exports clean, processed data back into Excel or other formats for reporting.

Tested basic processes in Alteryx using self-created sample data.
Applied common Excel-based operations to understand feasibility.
Gradually implemented simple tasks with partial success.
Identified areas where Alteryx can replace or enhance Excel workflows.
Recognized limitations and areas requiring further learning.
Compiled potential use cases for partial or full transformation.
