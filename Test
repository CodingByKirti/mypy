GIRS Problem Specification Document & Implementation Steps

Hi [Recipient's Name],

Thanks for today’s call.

I am attaching the GIRS Problem Specification document, which includes the proposal you shared. Additionally, I have added a new sheet outlining the Implementation Steps based on my understanding.

Please feel free to review and add any comments or new points in case I have missed anything. Your thumbs-up will help me proceed with the coding process.

Looking forward to your feedback!

Thanks,


Subject: Guidance Needed on Cost Template Automation

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope you're doing well.

I recently received a request from Priyanka and Sushma to automate the cost template work, which involves generating around 50 files and structuring the output in a predefined format. They mentioned that this is quite urgent.

At the same time, Chandra reached out to me, suggesting that I hold off on this as he has a better solution in mind. Given these differing inputs, I’m a bit unsure about how to proceed.

Could you please advise on the best way forward? I’d really appreciate your guidance on this.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Leavers Process	Adjusted the process to align with new L2/L3 changes.	✅ Completed (12-Mar)
Transaction Listing	Modified to reflect structural updates.	✅ Completed (11-Mar)
JML File	Under review by Ritu/Himangi.	⏳ In Progress
GIRS Activity	Developed a consolidated file with control checks. Awaiting input files and SOP from Sandipan/Nachiketa. (Discussed in person)	🔄 Pending (30-Mar-2025)
Cost Template	Discussion held with Priyanka. Considering Saqib’s file as the base. Chandra suggested pausing work as he has an alternative approach but needs time to finalize.	⏳ On Hold
SOD Process Walkthrough	Reviewed process with Rav Prasad. No automation scope identified due to dependency on multiple tools (Atlas, GIAM, EIM). Manual intervention required.	❌ No Scope

Alteryx simplifies and automates data tasks that Excel handles manually, reducing effort, saving time, and enhancing efficiency—especially for repetitive and complex workflows. While it excels in data preparation, transformation, and automation, tasks like real-time collaboration and report formatting may still require Excel.

Capabilities of Alteryx
Automates repetitive Excel tasks like data cleaning, merging, and filtering.
Handles large datasets efficiently without performance slowdowns.
Performs complex calculations and transformations with minimal effort.
Integrates data from multiple sources (Excel, databases, APIs, etc.).
Reduces manual errors through standardized workflows.
Enables advanced analytics such as forecasting, variance analysis, and trends.
Exports clean, processed data back into Excel or other formats for reporting.

Tested basic processes in Alteryx using self-created sample data.
Applied common Excel-based operations to understand feasibility.
Gradually implemented simple tasks with partial success.
Identified areas where Alteryx can replace or enhance Excel workflows.
Recognized limitations and areas requiring further learning.
Compiled potential use cases for partial or full transformation.

Business Managers (BMs): Engaged on a need basis for project details, but their availability is a challenge.
Engagement Methods:
Regular check-ins with Finance COE for alignment
Ad-hoc discussions with BMs for project inputs
Email/slack-based communication for automation requests
3. Key Challenges & Roadblocks
Limited Stakeholder Availability: Many projects stall due to delays in responses from BMs.
Lack of Process Documentation: SOPs are often missing, making automation difficult.
Resistance to Automation: Some stakeholders perceive automation as a threat to manual roles.
Scope Creep & Abandoned Projects: Stakeholders often change requirements midway or drop projects without communication.
✅ Past Attempts to Address Challenges:

Follow-ups to ensure clarity → Often leads to long delays.
Self-driven documentation → Requires additional effort without formal approvals.
Proactive automation suggestions → Met with hesitation or resistance.
4. Opportunities for Improvement & Next Steps
📌 Streamlining Engagement & Visibility:

Formalizing a structured automation request & approval process to avoid abandoned projects.
Setting clear timelines & checkpoints for stakeholder inputs to avoid indefinite waiting periods.
📌 Enhancing Documentation & SOPs:

Encouraging teams to maintain standardized process documents for smoother automation.
Proposing a central repository for business processes & automation requests.
📌 Driving a Proactive Automation Culture:

Showcasing successful automation use cases to demonstrate impact & encourage adoption.
Creating automation training sessions for stakeholders to ease resistance.
