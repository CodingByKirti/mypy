Here's an example code snippet that uses EasyGUI to create a base window with three buttons to open separate workbooks:
```
import easygui as eg

def open_workbook1():
    # Open workbook 1
    eg.msgbox("Opening Workbook 1...", title="Workbook 1")

def open_workbook2():
    # Open workbook 2
    eg.msgbox("Opening Workbook 2...", title="Workbook 2")

def open_workbook3():
    # Open workbook 3
    eg.msgbox("Opening Workbook 3...", title="Workbook 3")

# Create a base window with three buttons
buttons = ["Open Workbook 1", "Open Workbook 2", "Open Workbook 3"]
choice = eg.buttonbox(msg="Select a workbook to open", title="Workbook Selector", choices=buttons)

# Handle button clicks
if choice == "Open Workbook 1":
    open_workbook1()
elif choice == "Open Workbook 2":
    open_workbook2()
elif choice == "Open Workbook 3":
    open_workbook3()
```
This code creates a base window with three buttons using `eg.buttonbox`. Each button click calls a separate function to open the corresponding workbook. The `eg.msgbox` function is used to display a message box with a title, indicating which workbook is being opened.

Note: You'll need to replace the `eg.msgbox` calls with the actual code to open the workbooks.
