Initial Steps for Master File Creation

1. Leveraging Best Practices

    Using Position Tracker as the foundational framework to maintain consistency and efficiency.

2. Data Requirements from Business Managers

    Stock Tab: Specify required data columns.
    Forecast Tab: Confirm inclusion of confirmed hiring data, HR inputs, Taleo, and attrition details.
    Appian Data Exploration:
        Categorize Position ID against FRC (e.g., Replacements, BTO).
        Guidance on categorization is welcome.

3. Clarifications Needed

    Focus Area: Include only FTWs or expand to Contractors/Consultants?
    Additional Considerations: Any other elements to incorporate?

Implementation of Best Practices

    We will implement best practices from the position tracker file to create the master file.

Extending to Finance-Level Data

    The position tracker currently works with FinaOps-level data; we plan to extend it to work with Finance-level data.

Input Requirements

    Certain inputs are not captured in the existing file. We welcome suggestions for additional columns from the GHA and OR files.

Data Compilation

    Most of the data required for the master file has been gathered, except for the Anaplan extract, for which assistance is needed.

Taleo Report Reconciliation

    We will reconcile the data with the Taleo report to identify positions in the Taleo report but already present in the GHA file due to advanced hiring.

Anaplan & Appian Data Suggestions

    Whatâ€™s your recommendation: Should we add Anaplan and Appian data as separate sheets with the required columns, or would you suggest a different structure?
