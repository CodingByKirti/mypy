Subject: Next Steps for Master File Creation: Action Points & Data Requirements

Dear All,

As per my recent discussions with Sahil and Sourabh regarding the initial steps for the Master File creation, we have collectively agreed on the following approach:

    Leveraging Best Practices:
    We will be using the Position Tracker as the baseline framework for the Master File to maintain consistency and efficiency.

    Data Requirements from All BMs:
    In order to proceed, we would need some inputs from all Business Managers:
        Stock Tab: Please share your expectations on what data columns should be included in this tab.
        Forecast Tab: This will be used to incorporate confirmed hiring data (HR data), Taleo information, and attrition details. Kindly confirm if any additional data points are required.
        Appian Data Exploration: We will be categorizing each Position ID against FRC (e.g., replacements and BTO). Any guidance or specific requirements for this categorization would be appreciated.

    Clarifications Needed:
    A few questions need to be addressed to finalize the structure:
        Should this exercise focus only on Full-Time Workers (FTW), or should we include Contractors and Consultants as well?
        Are there any additional considerations that should be factored into this planning?

Your feedback and insights will be valuable as we move forward with these steps. Please feel free to add any suggestions or comments.

Looking forward to your responses.

Best Regards,


Implementation of Best Practices

    We will implement best practices from the position tracker file to create the master file.

Extending to Finance-Level Data

    The position tracker currently works with FinaOps-level data; we plan to extend it to work with Finance-level data.

Input Requirements

    Certain inputs are not captured in the existing file. We welcome suggestions for additional columns from the GHA and OR files.

Data Compilation

    Most of the data required for the master file has been gathered, except for the Anaplan extract, for which assistance is needed.

Taleo Report Reconciliation

    We will reconcile the data with the Taleo report to identify positions in the Taleo report but already present in the GHA file due to advanced hiring.

Anaplan & Appian Data Suggestions

    Whatâ€™s your recommendation: Should we add Anaplan and Appian data as separate sheets with the required columns, or would you suggest a different structure?
