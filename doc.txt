You want to replicate the Excel formula:

`=RIGHT(TEXT([column_name], "0000000000"), 10)`

in Python.

Here's the equivalent Python code:

```
import pandas as pd

assuming 'df' is your DataFrame and 'column_name' is the column you want to process

df['new_column'] = df['column_name'].apply(lambda x: str(x).zfill(10)[-10:])
```

Explanation:

1. `str(x).zfill(10)` pads the value with leading zeros to a minimum length of 10 characters.
2. `[-10:]` extracts the last 10 characters from the padded string.

This code creates a new column 'new_column' with the processed values.
