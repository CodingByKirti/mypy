Here’s the final self-assessment text incorporating all the discussed changes:
Self-Assessment for 2024

This year has been a productive one, marked by significant contributions to process automation, system improvements, and personal growth. Below is a summary of my key achievements and ongoing projects:
Key Achievements

    Process Automation: A central focus of my role has been automating key processes to improve efficiency and data accuracy. Notable projects include automation if:
        Consolidation of Finance FRP data with Fx rate, Skills Discovery Management: Automated data processing for skill discovery, enhancing insights into talent and skills.
        Hiring Role Review Data Extraction: Automated data extraction, segmentation, and organization for hiring reviews, creating a well-structured Excel file with formatted sheets for easy analysis.
        Standardized Hiring Review Input File: Created a standardized template for input data, ensuring consistency and reducing errors.
        Cost Model Value Update for Governance and Risk: Automated updates for governance-related cost models, streamlining accuracy.
        Finance FRP File Splitter and Consolidation: Simplified the process of splitting and consolidating files for the central model.
        Leavers Email Automation (Leaver Management): Developed Python code to automate leavers' email notifications for Ashish’s team, reducing dependency on Qlik and allowing the team to run the process independently.
        Hiring Review Template Update: Enhanced existing code to support new templates for L3 and L4 levels, increasing flexibility for future requirements.

    Ongoing Projects: Several critical automation projects are in progress, with the aim of further streamlining processes and enhancing data consistency:
        Transaction Listing Process Automation: Transitioned from MS Access to a Python-based solution, completed for HGSU and HGMS. Work on HGHQ is ongoing and has been challenging due to the need for reverse-engineering in the absence of the original database developer.
        Billing Process Automation: Developing a Python-based solution to streamline billing processes, reducing manual input and improving accuracy.
        Central Master File Development: Building a unified master file by combining datasets (e.g., GHA open positions, attrition, HR input), enhancing headcount tracking and forecasting.
        Automated TM1-Based Cost Reporting: Working on automating the generation of 40+ cost reports based on TM1 data extracts; awaiting inputs from other teams to move forward.
        Rate Card Mapping Automation: Automating the mapping of rate cards against GHA data, ensuring correct alignment and efficient data handling.

    QlikSense Dashboard Management: Took over management of essential QlikSense dashboards, including COO Cost Reporting and Finance Forecast, ensuring data is accessible and reliable for stakeholders.

    Training & Development:
        Completed the Appian Developer course, supporting my involvement in workflow automation projects.
        Earned the Technical AI Ambassador badge, enhancing my knowledge of AI applications in business processes to drive future automation.

    Business as Usual (BAU) Tasks: Took over key processes like Contractor Accruals, TM1 Data Extraction, and Transaction Listing. Although these tasks were later reassigned, learning the detailed steps, especially without a business background, provided a valuable understanding of core operations.

Lessons Learned

This year, I learned the importance of clear communication and proactive risk management. By consistently updating stakeholders on project status and challenges, I aim to ensure better alignment and manage expectations effectively. Early flagging of potential risks or delays has proven invaluable in maintaining smooth project progress. Additionally, stepping outside of my IT role to understand BAU processes has strengthened my cross-functional collaboration skills and deepened my business knowledge.

In summary, while there were challenges, I am proud of the progress made in automation and the positive impact these solutions have had on our team’s efficiency. I look forward to building on these foundations to deliver even greater value in the coming year.
