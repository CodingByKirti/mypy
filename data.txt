Subject: MoM: GSC Recharges Automation Discussion

Dear Team,

Here are the key points from our recent discussion:

    SOP Clarity: The SOP document is unclear and frequently changes. Previous work is often abandoned due to modified requirements.
    Adoption Uncertainty: Ms. R mentioned that the solution's adoption will be decided after it’s completed and delivered.
    New Requirements:
        Lookup PSID from the base input file (sent to Ops) with consolidated input from the SPOC file. Filter records where 'Billed/Not Billed' = 'Field to be updated'.
        Replace the "Review Sheet" with 'Multiple Billing Inputs' for data with the same PSID but differing attributes.
        Ensure Billing Contact PSID is 8 digits by adding preceding zeroes where necessary.
        Add a Comments column to the original sheet:
            "Not Validated": For Billing Contacts not present in last month's file.
            "Duplicate Record": If PSID and all other column values are the same, and 'Remarks from SPOC' is blank. Remove from the original sheet and keep in a separate 'Deleted Data' sheet with the comment.
            "FTE Count Mismatch": If PSID and other column values (except 'No. of FTE') are the same and the Sum of FTE ≠ 1.

Please let me know if further clarifications are needed.

Best regards,
