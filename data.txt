Subject: Next Steps for Finance Forecast Central File

Dear [Recipient's Name],

Following my implementation of the VBA code, I found that the approach of downsizing the file by removing named ranges and unused formulas is not worthwhile for our needs.

In today’s meeting with Sowmya and Sahil, we discussed that the next steps should involve bifurcating/slicing the new version of the Finance Forecast Central file by L4. After these changes, the concerned individuals will handle the consolidation of the file.

We welcome any thoughts or inputs you may have on this approach by tomorrow.

Thank you!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
