Here are the 9 points formatted as a table:

| *Point #* | *Description* |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | *Define Data Scope*: Will we need data for the current month only, or for the entire year for projection purposes? |
| 2 | *COS Centre Mapping*: Will we need to remap COS centres after finalizing the data? |
| 3 | *Month Identification*: How will we identify the month for the data? Is there a specific column we can reference? |
| 4 | *Separate Tables for L3 Levels*: With 133 different L3 levels, do we need to create separate tables for each level? |
| 5 | *Standardize L3 Level Names*: How will we standardize the names of L3 levels to ensure consistency? |
| 6 | *Special Characters in L3 Values*: Will L3 values contain special characters, or only alphanumeric characters? How will this impact the code? |
| 7 | *Frequency of Updates*: If we need data for the entire year, how frequently will we update the data? |
| 8 | *Rate Effects and Updates*: Will the rate effects be fixed or change with every month? How will we update previous data? |
| 9 | *Pivot Table Scope*: Are the pivot tables currently being plotted only for direct costs, or will we need to include indirect and other costs as well? |
