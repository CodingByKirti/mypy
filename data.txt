Subject: Updated Billing Output File & Responses to Raised Points

Dear [Process Owner's Name],

As discussed, I have reviewed and addressed the points raised in your last email. The updated Billing Output file is attached along with a detailed response document outlining the status of each point.

Summary of Key Updates:
Corrections have been made to employee details, AID, billing details, and cost centers.
Existing reasons for non-billable positions are now retained, and dropdowns have been added where applicable.
Certain points, such as FTE updates and open positions, require further clarification.
Control checks and additional columns (Manager Operations & AVP) have been incorporated.
For points requiring confirmation, I have highlighted them in the attached document. Please review and let me know if any adjustments are needed.

Let me know if you need any further clarifications.

Best regards,
