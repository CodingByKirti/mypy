=SUMPRODUCT((SourceData!$B$2:$B$1000="Finance Operations") * (SourceData!$C$2:$C$1000=$B3) * (TEXT(SourceData!$A$2:$A$1000,"MMM YY")=TEXT(C$2,"MMM YY")))
Filters Recipient L3 to "Finance Operations".
Matches BF Level 3 with the value in column B ($B3).
Compares the Onboarding Month (formatted as "MMM YY") with the summary table header month (C$2).

Yes, you can add this logging configuration to your IPython notebook (IPynb file). Here's where you can add it:

1. Create a new cell at the top of your notebook.
2. Add the logging configuration code to this cell.

This cell should be executed before any other cells that use the logger. You can achieve this by:

1. Running all cells in order (Kernel > Restart & Run All).
2. Ensuring that the logging cell is executed before any other cells that use the logger.

Alternatively, you can also add this logging configuration to a separate Python file (e.g., `logging_config.py`) and import it in your IPynb file. This way, you can keep your logging configuration separate from your notebook code.

Here's an example:

logging_config.py:

```
import logging

Create a logger
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

Create a file handler
handler = logging.FileHandler('log_file.log')
handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

Create a formatter and set it for the handler
formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
handler.setFormatter(formatter)

Add the handler to the logger
logger.addHandler(handler)
```

IPynb file:

```
import logging
from logging_config import logger

Rest of your code...
```
