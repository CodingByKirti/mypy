Subject: Reminder: Seeking Your Input on Automation Opportunities

Dear All,

I hope you're doing well.

I appreciate the inputs received so far, especially from Ritu’s team. However, I’m still awaiting insights from the other teams. Your feedback is crucial in identifying areas where automation can reduce manual effort, enhance efficiency, and allow you to focus more on high-value tasks.

If you haven’t shared your thoughts yet, I’d really appreciate it if you could do so at the earliest, as I need to prioritize my book of work accordingly. Please feel free to schedule a meeting or reach out to me directly to discuss any identified automation opportunities.

Looking forward to your responses and hoping to collaborate on solutions that benefit your team.

Best regards,
