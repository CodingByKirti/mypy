Subject: Weekly Update

Dear [Boss's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. Below is the summary of my work for this week:

    HDPI Financials:
        Task completed and tested.
        Encountered a glitch in the nominal mappings used; discussed this with Anshul.
        Awaiting the standard nominal mapping file from Sahil to update and finalize the code.

    Time-to-Hire Report:
        Updated the Qlik dashboard as per new requirements.
        The task is completed.

    Transaction Listing Automation:
        The file is ready for testing.
        However, the nominal mappings issue also applies here. Hoping to receive the corrected mappings by the beginning of next week.

    Finance FRP Data Structuring for Anaplan:
        Code for preparing and structuring the data is completed and delivered.
        This was done on a priority basis.

    Organization Structure for Direct Reportees:
        Had a call with Kasturi regarding creating the structure for multiple countries as requested by Krystel.
        Awaiting sample input from Sahil Goyal to proceed. This is marked as a priority for completion next week.

    Automating Reminders for Special Days:
        Assisted Himangi by writing Python code to automate scheduling reminders for special team events throughout the year.

Despite feeling unwell this week, I managed to complete most of the assigned tasks. Please let me know if there are any additional updates or priorities for next week.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
